## ⚙️ **What is the piscine**
The piscine of school 42 is a <ins>1 month exam</ins> to discover C language, test your skills in programming/unix/**coding**, test your **logic** and, most importantly, to see if the school fits you and **if you fit the school**.

## ➡️ **My background**
I was a **total novice**. Didn't know anything about `code` or `C language`.

I trained a bit before the piscine by trying to do the first exercises but it was really hard on my own. In the piscine, I found it really easier since there were a lot of people I could chat with to help me understand.

## 🧠 **What I learned**
- [x] How to navigate in a terminal
- [x] How to create and edit files with Vim
- [x] How to code in C
- [x] While loops, if conditions
- [x] What are a char, an integer, a string and how to manipulate them
- [x] And a lot more...

## ♻️ **Disclaimer**
If you want to do the piscine yourself, you can find the subjects online but, also, the answers. I strongly suggest you do not copy this answers without thinking. Learning to code is making mistakes and learning from it. You will never succeed if you just copy what others have already done.

But if you want to practice before the Piscine or just learn C, you are welcome to use my code! 🙂
